# **Canvas** model

In the **Canvas** model, you start with a blank layout and you can add zones that can be dragged and resized. You can use keyboard for zone editing:
    
- The **arrows** (up, down, left, right) - to move a zone by 10 pixels
- **Ctrl+arrow** - to move a zone by 1 pixel
- **Shift+arrow** - to resize a zone by 10 pixels (5 per edge)
- **Ctrl+Shift+arrow** - to resize a zone by 2 pixels (1 per edge)
- **Ctrl+Tab** - to switch between the editor and dialog.
